# Next.js Navigation Issue: router.push() Unexpected Behavior

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the `next/router.push()` method in Next.js applications for client-side navigation.  The issue is that under certain conditions, the navigation may fail to update the page content or may result in an incorrect URL being displayed.  This example illustrates the problem and provides a solution.

## Bug Description

When navigating from the `/about` page back to the `/` (home) page using `router.push('/')`, the navigation may not always update the UI correctly.  The URL might change but the displayed content might remain on the `/about` page.

2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
